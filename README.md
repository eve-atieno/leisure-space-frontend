# LEISURE SPACE

## Project Description

Leisure Space is an online marketplace that connects users with unique and cool spaces that can be rented by the hour or day for meetings, events, or activities. The platform brings together people with a shared passion or interest in a particular area, allowing them to meet, create, and celebrate within a cool environment generated by willing space owners around the country.

### User Journey:

- Register for an account by clicking on the "Register" button and filling out the registration form with personal information and creating a password.

- Log in to the platform using social or local authentication.

- Search for a space by entering location, date, and duration parameters.

- Book the selected space for the desired duration and review the total amount to be paid, which is calculated based on the duration.

- Accept the terms and conditions of the agreement incubator before proceeding to payment.

- Simulate the payment process, including billing and invoicing of any space booked.
